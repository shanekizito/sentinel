**Sentinel** is a planetary-scale, autonomous security governance platform. It unifies **Neural Geometries (GCN/Transformer)** with **Symbolic Reasoning (Z3/SMT)** into a single, antifragile intelligence capable of ingesting trillions of lines of code and proving their security properties in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Neural Graph Differential Equations
We treat code execution as a continuous dynamical system, using **Neural ODEs** and **Linear Attention Transformers** to handle infinite context windows.

### 2. The Sovereign AGI ("Omega")
An autonomous agentic controller that lives on the server, running a real-time **OODA Loop** to patch vulnerabilities and verify logic using Z3 solvers.

### 3. Universal Polyglot Ingestion
One engine for **15+ Enterprise Languages** (Rust, Python, Go, Java, C++, etc.), compiling them into **Binary V5 Shards** for high-performance training.
